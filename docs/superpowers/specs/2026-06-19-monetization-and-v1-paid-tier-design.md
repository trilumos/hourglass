# Monetization Model & v1 Paid Tier — Design Spec (Sustain)

> **Status:** Model + v1 scope LOCKED by founder 2026-06-19 (brainstormed this
> session). This spec defines (1) the **durable monetization model** for Sustain
> and (2) the concrete **v1 paid tier** to build and ship. It supersedes the
> open "Monetization" item in `project-context.md` and the launch-checklist §9.
> Subsequent builds it references (the cosmetic Store engine; enhanced Pro
> Insights analytics) get their own specs.

## 1. Principles (non-negotiable)

- **Free core, always.** The focus loop (Flow/Pomodoro/Custom, unlimited),
  Focus Score, streak, basic stats, the default Sand look, and the session
  ritual are never paywalled.
- **No ads, ever.** Make it a brand promise. Ads fight a focus app's whole value
  and would break the no-telemetry privacy story.
- **No dark patterns.** Conversion comes from *wanting* premium, never from
  degrading the free experience.
- **Lifetime is offered only for zero-ongoing-cost (on-device) things → Pro.
  Anything with real ongoing cost/content → Plus, subscription-only.** This is
  what keeps a paid focus app from feeling extractive ("Forest is unusable
  without paying" — the thing to avoid).
- **Decide a feature's tier at launch, not later.** Gating a previously-free
  feature in a later version reads as "you took away what was free" — review
  poison. (This is why detailed Insights is Pro from v1, not free-then-gated.)

## 2. The model (durable — full picture)

**Tiers**
- **Free (always):** core loop; Focus Score, streak, Today/Total/Average; **basic
  Insights** (Records + consistency heatmap); default **Sand** look; **Sand
  soundscape + session/break sound cues**; profile, guide, onboarding.
- **Pro** — on-device premium. **v1: one-time lifetime only.** v1.2 adds
  **monthly / yearly** options (same Pro). The lifetime option is what keeps the
  subscription honest (no one is forced to rent finite on-device features).
- **Plus** — subscription-**only** (launches **v1.2**). Unlocks **everything**
  (Pro + connected/ongoing features). Recurring is fair here because the value is
  ongoing (servers + continuously-delivered content).
- **À la carte** — buy individual cosmetics one-time (v1: complete color themes;
  v1.2: the full categorized store).

**Feature → tier × release**

| Feature | Tier | Release |
|---|---|---|
| Core loop, Focus Score, streak, basic stats | Free | v1 |
| Basic Insights (Records + heatmap) | Free | v1 |
| Session/break **sound cues** | Free | v1 |
| Default **Sand** look + Sand soundscape | Free | v1 |
| **Detailed + enhanced Insights** | **Pro** | **v1** |
| **Color themes** (app palette + hourglass colors) | **Pro (bundled) + à la carte** | **v1** |
| Todo/task library, widgets, share cards, break activities, +more themes/soundscapes | Pro | v1.2 |
| Pro **monthly/yearly** options | Pro | v1.2 |
| Full categorized **Store** (shapes · elements · app themes · packs · soundscapes) | à la carte + Plus | v1.2 |
| Cloud **sync** + cross-device | Plus | v1.2 |
| Seasonal/festival drops, "whole store included" | Plus | v1.2 |
| **Training modules**, **PC/Web blocking**, PC/Web apps | Plus | v2 |
| Daily tips/quotes (bundled, in-app; no "come back" nudges) | Pro | v1.2 |
| Reminders/scheduling (local notifications) | Pro | v1.2 |

(Pricing finalized later, incl. India ₹ tiers. Rough: à la carte themes
**$1.99–2.99**, Pro lifetime **~$19.99**; v1.2 Pro yearly **~$14.99** / monthly
**~$2.99**; Plus **~$2.99/mo**.)

## 3. v1 scope — what we build & ship

v1 monetization is intentionally lean: **one-time purchases only** (no
subscriptions yet), no full store UI, no gating of anything except the new
detailed-Insights split.

### 3.1 Billing & entitlements (RevenueCat over Play Billing)
- Use **RevenueCat** even for one-time products — it gives clean **purchase +
  restore + entitlement** handling and **zero rework** when subscriptions land in
  v1.2. (Leaner alternative `in_app_purchase` was considered; RevenueCat is the
  pre-chosen tool and wins on restore + future subs.)
- **Products (v1, all one-time / non-consumable):**
  - `pro.lifetime` → grants the **`pro`** entitlement (enhanced Insights + all
    current bundled themes).
  - one product **per à la carte theme**, e.g. `theme.obsidian`, `theme.sage`,
    `theme.rose` → grants ownership of that theme.
- **Entitlement model (on-device, from RevenueCat customer info, cached offline):**
  - `pro` = owns `pro.lifetime`.
  - A theme is **owned** if `pro` is active **OR** its `theme.<id>` is purchased.
  - `Sand` (default) is always owned/free.
- **Restore purchases** — explicit button (Settings + paywall). Required by stores.
- **Offline:** RevenueCat caches entitlements; the app reads the cache and never
  blocks the free experience if the network/billing is unavailable.
- A single `entitlementsProvider` (Riverpod) exposes `{ pro: bool,
  ownedThemeIds: Set<String> }`; all gating reads from it. This is the contract
  every future paid feature gates against.

### 3.2 Color themes (the v1 cosmetics)
Built on the **existing** token + skin architecture (design-language §2, §8) —
no new hourglass *silhouette* (that's the v1.2 store). Each theme is a complete
**color look**:
- A `HgTheme` (light + dark `HgTokens`) — the app palette. (`HgThemes.all`
  already exists; today only `Sand`.)
- A matching **hourglass skin** (`HourglassSkin` colors: sand/grain/glass) per
  theme + brightness.
- **Wiring change:** today `HourglassView` picks its skin by brightness
  (`classic`/`classicLight`), not by theme. Add the active theme's skin to
  `HgTheme` and expose it via a provider (e.g. `activeSkinProvider`); the
  `HourglassView` callers (Home, Session, Completion, Onboarding) pass it. Falls
  back to Sand's skin. Contained, follows the "skins are data" design rule.
- **Selection/ownership:** `ThemeController` already persists `themeId`. Extend so
  a theme can be **selected only if owned**; selecting a locked theme opens the
  purchase flow. `ThemeMode` (light/dark/system) stays orthogonal.
- **Catalog for v1:** a small curated set of color looks (e.g. **Obsidian,
  Sage, Rose** — final palettes are a design task, see §5). Each is à la carte;
  all current ones are bundled into Pro.

### 3.3 Themes screen (browse / buy / apply / restore)
A simple, calm **Themes** screen (not the full categorized store):
- Lists looks as preview tiles (the hourglass + a palette swatch), marked
  Owned / price / "in Pro".
- Tap → preview + **Apply** (if owned) or **Buy** (purchase flow) or **Get Pro**.
- **Restore purchases** action.
- **Entry point:** a "Themes" row in Settings (and/or Profile) — decide during
  build; Settings is the natural home.

### 3.4 Detailed + enhanced Insights (the Pro anchor)
- **Free Insights** = Records + consistency heatmap.
- **Pro Insights** = the **current** depth (Week/Month/All toggle, focus-over-time
  `BarReadoutChart`, when-you-focus time-of-day + day-of-week, by-mode donut,
  period comparison, personalized copy) **+ a starter set of new analytics** to
  make Pro clearly worth it. **Candidate enhancements** (final selection +
  detailed design in a short follow-on Insights pass, see §5): Focus Score trend
  over time; Focus Stamina growth; a daily/weekly **focus goal + progress**;
  completion/consistency stats + best-focus-window recommendation;
  what-you-focused-on (intention) breakdown; **CSV export**.
- **Gating UX:** the free user sees Records + heatmap, then a calm, honest
  upsell panel where the depth would be ("See your full focus story with Pro"),
  never a nag. No data is hidden that the free tier ever had.

### 3.5 Session / break sound cues (free)
- Short, premium cues on **session start, session end, break start, break end**.
- Local audio via **`just_audio`** (pre-chosen dep); bundled **CC0** assets with
  `assets/audio/CREDITS.md` (sourcing is a real task — see §5).
- A **Settings toggle** (sounds on/off). Respect silent mode sensibly.
- These are *ritual feedback*, free — distinct from premium **soundscapes**
  (ambient focus audio), which are v1.2 Pro.

## 4. v1.2+ (recorded, not built now)
- **v1.2:** full categorized **Store** (hourglass shapes · elements · app themes ·
  complete packs · soundscapes); **Pro monthly/yearly**; **Plus** subscription
  launches (cloud **sync** + cross-device, whole store + seasonal drops); Pro
  gains todo/task library, widgets, share cards, break activities, daily
  tips/quotes (bundled, in-app), reminders (local notifications), more themes +
  soundscapes; the cloud backend (its real job = sync, **not** quotes).
- **v2:** **training modules** (ongoing curriculum → Plus), **PC/Web blocking**,
  PC/Web apps.
- **Never:** ads; "come back" engagement push notifications.

---

## 5. Dependent designs & open items (decomposition)
This spec is the money model + v1 paid plumbing. These are tracked separately so
v1 stays shippable:
- **Enhanced Pro Insights analytics** — a short follow-on design pass (pick the
  §3.4 enhancements, design charts/calc; reuse the `AnalyticsCalculator` pattern).
  Needed for v1 (the Pro anchor must feel worth it).
- **Color-theme palettes** — design the actual looks (Obsidian/Sage/Rose…): the
  `HgTokens` light+dark + matching `HourglassSkin` for each. A focused design +
  on-device tuning task (the hourglass is the hero — colors must look premium).
- **CC0 audio sourcing** — session/break cues now; soundscapes for v1.2. CREDITS.
- **Pricing** — final tiers per market (incl. ₹).
- **The v1.2 cosmetic Store engine** (shapes/elements/packs) — its own spec.
- **Launch-checklist interaction:** adding IAP means the Play **Data Safety** form
  + a **privacy policy** must disclose purchase processing (Google Play +
  RevenueCat handle purchase tokens + an anonymous app-user id). This is *billing*
  data, not behavior tracking — the "no analytics/telemetry" story still holds,
  but the disclosure is required. (Also still owed before publish: real release
  keystore, R8 keep-rules so the release build succeeds, `allowBackup=false`.)

---

## 6. Testing
- **Entitlements (pure/unit):** `pro` true iff `pro.lifetime` owned; theme owned
  iff `pro` OR `theme.<id>` owned; Sand always owned. Mock RevenueCat customer
  info. Offline cache path returns last-known entitlements.
- **Theme selection:** can select owned themes; selecting a locked theme triggers
  purchase, not apply; `themeId` persists; active skin follows the theme.
- **Insights gating:** free shows Records + heatmap + upsell; `pro` shows the full
  set. No crash when entitlements are loading.
- **Sound cues:** play on each ritual transition; toggle silences them; no audio
  in tests (inject a no-op player).
- **Widget tests** for the Themes screen (owned/locked/Pro states, restore).
- Run serial: `flutter test --concurrency=1`; `flutter analyze` clean. Mock all
  billing — no real network in tests.

---

## 7. Build order (for the planning phase)
1. **Entitlement engine** (RevenueCat + `entitlementsProvider` + restore) — the
   contract everything else gates against.
2. **Color-theme system** (HgTheme→skin wiring + ownership-gated selection) +
   **Themes screen** + theme products.
3. **Insights free/Pro split** + the chosen **enhanced analytics** (after the
   short Insights design pass).
4. **Session/break sound cues** (independent; can land any time).
5. **Launch hardening** (release build/R8, keystore, allowBackup, privacy policy,
   Data Safety) — gates publish.

Each becomes its own plan; the enhanced-Insights analytics + the theme palettes
get a quick design pass first.
